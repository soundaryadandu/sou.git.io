            <p>I soundarya know that I am special and there's no one else out there that's like me... so enjoy! (smile)

                    I was born in Kaikaluru on November 1, 1996. I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my younger Sister, would appear one year later after my own birth.
                    
                    Like my dad, I am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal computer during my spare time.I lived in . For one year before I came to bangalore, I lived in Vizag, and then moved to hyderabad since my high school graduation.
                    
                    Becoming a Social Worker/full-time ministry has become my plan, especially when I like working with special needs Kids. I planned in working in the field of Education as a Social Worker and Preach the Word of God.
                    
                    Finally, it wouldn't hurt to travel to amazing places, continue to meet wonderful people, finish my Education/graduate school and eventually meet the young woman that the Lord has intended for me.
